## Getting Started

Welcome to the VS Code Java world. Here is a guideline to help you get started to write Java code in Visual Studio Code.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).

## TIC TAC TOE
This is a simple Tic Tac Toe game, with 2 players switching back and forth. 

Each player enters the coordinates of the location they want to fill with their respective sides, X or 0.

When one player gets 3 locations in a row, the game ends and that play wins. 

If the entire board fills and no player has 3 in a row, neither player wins.
