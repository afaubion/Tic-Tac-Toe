TIC TAC TOE
This is a simple Tic Tac Toe game, with 2 players switching back and forth.

Each player enters the coordinates of the location they want to fill with their respective sides, X or 0.

When one player gets 3 locations in a row, the game ends and that play wins.

If the entire board fills and no player has 3 in a row, neither player wins.

This is implemented in Java, C++, and Python.
